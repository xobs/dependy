Dependy: Dependency Generation
=================================

Dependy is a relatively complex dependency resolver designed for solving tests.

With a standard dependency resolver, you fill it with items, ask it to resolve dependencies, and then you're done.

With Dependy, items can Require or Suggest other Dependencies, allowing some elements to fail.
